The label corresponds to the name of the datafile. For example, in ‘Lable.txt’ Row 5 is ‘1’, meaning that the label of ‘data/5.txt’ is 1. 

The relationship between label and event type is that:
0: SIF, 1:MIF, 2: PF, 3: TD.

The waveform data are in a 1312*7 format, where each column represents a variable and each row represents a sampling point. 

The variables are listed in the order: Ia, Ib, Ic, In, Va, Vb, Vc.

Power frequency of the systems is 50Hz, and sampling rate is 4096Hz.

These waveforms are directly from measurements. Since the voltage division ratio of three phases are not always the same, you need to consider normalizing the voltage waveform before using.

Due to the principle of measurement, the voltage waveform is not so accurate as current waveform.
